// Create an object. Feel free to use the given example.
// Create another object that has the same properties but different values.
// Go ahead and type console.log(person) where person is the first object you created. Follow along with the second object.
// We are now going to add our objects to an array. Go ahead and do that.
// Log the array as well. (follow step 3 but replace person with the name of the array)
// Once this is all done, open up the web page and open up the developer tools. You should see all of this logged on to the console.
